I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/">Computer Security Group</a> at ETH Zurich, led by <a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/people/kaveh-razavi/">Prof. Kaveh Razavi</a>. Also, I teach Computer Security and Computer Engineering in the <a href="https://www.ee.ethz.ch/">D-ITET</a>, ETH Zurich. I completed my PhD at National University of Singapore (NUS) with <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tcarlson/">Prof. Trevor E. Carlson</a>. My PhD thesis explores innovative solutions to build efficient and secure processors through hardware/software co-design. My current research has expanded into broader areas of hardware security, including DRAM read disturbance vulnerabilities and the analysis of real-world attacks on modern DRAM devices and CPUs.

My research has been recognized and supported by the School of Computing CS PhD Thesis Award (Honorable Mention), Dean's Graduate Research Excellence Award, 61st DAC Best Paper Award nomination, President's Graduate Fellowship (2019-2023), NUSGS Research Incentive Award, and Research Achievement Award.
