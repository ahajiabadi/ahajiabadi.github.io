I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Computer Security Group at ETH Zurich, led by Prof. Kaveh Razavi. I completed my PhD at National University of Singapore (NUS) with Prof. Trevor E. Carlson. My PhD thesis explores innovative solutions to build efficient and secure processors through hardware/software co-design. 

My research has been recognized and supported by the School of Computing CS PhD Thesis Award (Honorable Mention), Dean's Graduate Research Excellence Award (AY2023/2024), 61st DAC Best Paper Award nomination, and President's Graduate Fellowship (2019-2023).
